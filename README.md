# XBee-Gateway-Traffic-Visualisation-
An XBee device is operating as a gateway and it will collect the data that are sent by other devices. Next it will parse the data and pass them through serial port. Then a GUI read the serial port communication and visualise the devices and the data that the specific one has sent.
